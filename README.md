# ðŸš€ Gud: The One-File Wonder Editor

Welcome to Gud, where I've stuffed an entire text editor into a single HTML file because... why not?

## ðŸŽ­ What's This Madness?

Gud is a text editor that's so minimal, it makes Marie Kondo look like a hoarder. It's an entire development environment crammed into one index.html file. Yes, you read that right. One. File.

## âœ¨ Features That'll Knock Your Socks Off

- Zen Mode: So distraction-free, you might forget you're coding
- Language Switcher: It's like a linguistic mood ring for your code
- Vim Bindings: For when you want your fingers to do gymnastics
- Gruvbox Dark Theme: Because staring into the void is cool now
- One-File Wonder: It's so compact, it makes sardines feel claustrophobic!

## ðŸ”§ Languages

Use the dropdown menu to switch between:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Python
- XML

## ðŸ¤” Why?

Why not? I was so preoccupied with whether I could, I didn't stop to think if I should.

Remember, Gud is not just a text editor, it's a lifestyle. A questionable one, but a lifestyle nonetheless.

Now go forth and code in a single file like the mad scientist you are! ðŸ§ªðŸ‘¨ðŸ”¬ðŸ‘©ðŸ”¬
